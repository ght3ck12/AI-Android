# AI-Android
An AI Android that uses artificial neurons.  Add to its vocabulary and chat with it.  It can view the screen and hear sound through the microphone, so you can even play it music!

Once the application is open:
Here is the description of the various controls:
The button:  "Edit Base Vocabulary" opens a view that enables you to add and remove vocabulary phrases.  This is a good starting point for usage.
Once you have some phrases added, type into the text field in the main view and press enter on the keyboard to see what the android's responses are to what you say.
The button:  "Toggle thinking" adds a variable amount of delay to enable the android to think a bit before speaking.
The button:  "Toggle memories" enables the android to choose things you said to repeat back to you.  E.G. "Remember when you said:  x?"
The button:  "Toggle Multiple Responses" Enables the android to speak multiple responses in one conversation segment.
The button:  "Toggle Monitor" tests the microphone by playing it through the speakers.  You should need this only once or twice.
The button:  "Make Decision" opens a decision making view where you can add a question and entries for the android to choose from in reply.
The button:  "Show forms" enables a somewhat complex phrase construction builder, which I will explain in the next section of this readme.
The buttons:  "+" and "-" add and remove vocabularies - sets of phrases.  When you press "+" a dialog comes up that enables you to name the new vocabulary.
The combo box to the right of "+" and "-" selects which vocabulary you want to use.
The button:  "Phrase construction" toggles phrase construction in some of the responses.

Show Forms:
Once Form Editor is open, click "Edit Word Bank" and add some words and their closest part of speech.  Its fairly self-explanatory to do this.
Then, you can arrange them in patterns in the Form Editor by adding forms and entering a phrase with the words you used in edit word bank.  Using the combo boxes, you can get exactly what arrangement you want.  E.G. Pronoun action-verb adjective.

And enjoy using the AI Android!
